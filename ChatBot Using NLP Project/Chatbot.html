/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

it&#39;s an ugly day today.
neg: 0.452, neu: 0.548, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5106, 
i know. i think it may rain.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s the middle of summer, it shouldn&#39;t rain today.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that would be weird.
neg: 0.362, neu: 0.638, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1779, 
yeah, especially since it&#39;s ninety degrees outside.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.268, compound: 0.296, 
i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.

yes, it would be. 
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
i really wish it wasn&#39;t so hot every day. 
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.7, pos: 0.3, compound: 0.4576, 
me too. i can&#39;t wait until winter.

i&#39;d rather be cold than hot.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it doesn&#39;t look very nice outside today.

you&#39;re right. i think it&#39;s going to rain later.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
in the middle of the summer, it shouldn&#39;t be raining.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that wouldn&#39;t seem right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
considering that it&#39;s over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
neg: 0.145, neu: 0.855, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1779, 
exactly, it wouldn&#39;t be nice if it started raining. it&#39;s too hot.

i know, you&#39;re absolutely right.

it wouldn&#39;t seem right if it started raining right now.

it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
neg: 0.134, neu: 0.866, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1779, 
any rain right now would be pointless.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s right, it really would be.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i want it to cool down some.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.3818,

it doesn&#39;t matter. old blades cut, new blades cut.
neg: 0.468, neu: 0.532, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5063, 
maybe you should use an electric shaver.

they make a lot of noise, but they don&#39;t give a close shave.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

why do you have to think about it?

because a puppy costs money.

neg: 0.551, neu: 0.449, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5996,

the tv news doesn&#39;t tell us the race anymore.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
of course not. that would be racist.
neg: 0.4, neu: 0.6, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6124, 
but how can we identify someone if we don&#39;t know their race?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
don&#39;t ask me.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

but i don&#39;t have a tissue.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i didn&#39;t have time to get one from there.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
your sleeves are not tissues.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.628, pos: 0.372, compound: 0.631, 
that doesn&#39;t make it right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i will talk to your father about that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
your daddy was a good little boy.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.633, pos: 0.367, compound: 0.4404,

you should be happy, not worried.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.417, pos: 0.583, compound: 0.6796, 
i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.749, pos: 0.251, compound: 0.3291, 
yes, you have to take care of your wife.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.543, pos: 0.457, compound: 0.7096, 
and i have to take care of our children.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.314, compound: 0.4939,

neg: 0.0, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.333, compound: 0.4588, 
that sounds wonderful.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.351, pos: 0.649, compound: 0.5719, 
except we can&#39;t afford it!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t get art.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
or artists.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re in a different world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
neg: 0.167, neu: 0.833, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2023, 
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
neg: 0.172, neu: 0.828, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3595, 
artists see things differently.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
of course! he&#39;s world famous.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did he ever take art lessons?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i can&#39;t believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.783, pos: 0.217, compound: 0.3612, 
what&#39;s the point?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the point of what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
of living.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who knows? you live, and then you die.
neg: 0.358, neu: 0.642, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5994, 
we must be here for some reason.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe we&#39;re here to have fun.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.602, pos: 0.398, compound: 0.5106, 
then why aren&#39;t i having fun?
neg: 0.403, neu: 0.597, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4023, 
because you&#39;re thinking too much.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so i should stop thinking?
neg: 0.452, neu: 0.548, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3566, 
stop thinking about what the point is.
neg: 0.268, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
okay. i&#39;ll start thinking about having some fun.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.536, pos: 0.464, compound: 0.6369, 
beer is a powerful drug.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.517, pos: 0.483, compound: 0.4215, 
so are cigarettes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
which would you prefer?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
neg: 0.203, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.172, compound: -0.1531, 
i could pick only one or the other?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. nothing&#39;s perfect, not even in heaven.
neg: 0.206, neu: 0.305, pos: 0.488, compound: 0.5716, 
boy, that&#39;s a tough one.
neg: 0.333, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.128, 
what&#39;s so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes.

after that, we can dry it with a towel.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

so why did you get a ticket?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the officer said the red hand was blinking.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.314, compound: 0.4939, 
was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

that&#39;s not a good start.
neg: 0.445, neu: 0.555, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3412, 
then he didn&#39;t bother to apologize.
neg: 0.177, neu: 0.546, pos: 0.278, compound: 0.1877, 
that&#39;s rude.
neg: 0.75, neu: 0.25, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4588, 
then he drove too fast to the restaurant.

what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, you can&#39;t blame a man for asking.

he should act his age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

neg: 0.0, neu: 0.556, pos: 0.444, compound: 0.6808, 
i don&#39;t mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh. but that can be a curse.
neg: 0.487, neu: 0.513, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6956, 
yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.

sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you don&#39;t need a good nose for thatcigarettes stink.
neg: 0.46, neu: 0.54, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6256, 
but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!

yes, but it isn&#39;t a fast-food restaurant, is it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.791, pos: 0.209, compound: 0.2144, 
it&#39;s the slowest hamburger in town.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s because they cook it while you wait.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. that&#39;s why it&#39;s also the best hamburger in town.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.537, pos: 0.463, compound: 0.7845, 
a great burger and great service.

this steak has too much fat.

what do you want the waiter to do?

why not?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
neg: 0.116, neu: 0.884, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
you&#39;re crazy.
neg: 0.706, neu: 0.294, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.848, pos: 0.152, compound: 0.3612, 
where do you get these crazy ideas?
neg: 0.286, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
let&#39;s leave.

that&#39;s disgusting.
neg: 0.773, neu: 0.227, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
and he poured water into our glasses.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yuck! no water for me.
neg: 0.384, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3595, 
i wonder if the cooks&#39; nails are dirty, too.
neg: 0.293, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
this hot bread is delicious.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.481, compound: 0.5719, 
i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.

no. look at the bill when we get it. there&#39;s no charge for the bread.
neg: 0.253, neu: 0.747, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
it is delicious, especially with butter.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.575, pos: 0.425, compound: 0.5719, 
i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
neg: 0.098, neu: 0.902, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
they probably wouldn&#39;t like that.
neg: 0.345, neu: 0.655, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2755, 
i&#39;m eating so much bread that i&#39;m getting full.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
then stop eating the bread!
neg: 0.384, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3595, 
okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.375, compound: 0.4939, 
if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.

i&#39;m going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.6808, 
you&#39;re not going to examine it before we order dinner?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, i&#39;d rather not find out that it&#39;s dirty, because i&#39;m pretty hungry right now.

neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn&#39;t our waiter.
neg: 0.307, neu: 0.693, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
neg: 0.118, neu: 0.882, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
i&#39;ll go up front and talk to the manager.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good idea.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
maybe they&#39;ll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.268, compound: 0.5106, 
maybe he&#39;ll send us our waiter immediately.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
every time we eat out, it&#39;s an adventure.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.753, pos: 0.247, compound: 0.3182,

is it beautiful?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.339, pos: 0.661, compound: 0.5994, 
it&#39;s just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so it&#39;s not worth much?
neg: 0.325, neu: 0.675, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2334,

you hit a white ball.

and then you hit it again.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the point?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

it can be dangerous.
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
you mean he could drown.
neg: 0.481, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
he shouldn&#39;t scuba dive until he retires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but he dives to relax.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.51, pos: 0.49, compound: 0.5927, 
he might relax, but it makes me nervous.
neg: 0.25, neu: 0.566, pos: 0.184, compound: -0.1779, 
did you watch that golf tournament?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the one that tiger won?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.481, compound: 0.5719, 
how did he do it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it was nothing for him.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.746, pos: 0.254, compound: 0.6239, 
he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.774, pos: 0.226, compound: 0.5859, 
i think he is from outer space.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no human could possibly play golf that well.
neg: 0.188, neu: 0.427, pos: 0.385, compound: 0.3182, 
whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.275, compound: 0.5859, 
no human can do that.
neg: 0.355, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
somebody should check his birth record.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who&#39;s the greatest baseball player?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.488, pos: 0.512, compound: 0.6369, 
there are so many great players.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.533, pos: 0.467, compound: 0.6573, 
yes, but who is the greatest?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.343, pos: 0.657, compound: 0.8248, 
i&#39;d have to say babe ruth.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
most people would say that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he changed the game.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, he made the home run popular.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.524, compound: 0.6705, 
everybody loved him, all over the nation.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.606, pos: 0.394, compound: 0.5994, 
he helped make the yankees the best team ever.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.656, pos: 0.344, compound: 0.6369, 
and ruth was a good person, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.633, pos: 0.367, compound: 0.4404, 
he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
neg: 0.243, neu: 0.515, pos: 0.243, compound: 0.0, 
did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, please tell me.
neg: 0.338, neu: 0.308, pos: 0.354, compound: 0.0258, 
someone punched out someone.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s not nice.
neg: 0.538, neu: 0.462, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3252, 
it&#39;s worse than that.
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
how so?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
two guys got into an argument.
neg: 0.333, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3612, 
i&#39;ll bet they were drinking.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a third guy punched one of the two guys.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;ll bet he was drinking, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
neg: 0.388, neu: 0.612, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6908, 
i want to go to the ball game.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.822, pos: 0.178, compound: 0.0772, 
is there a game tonight?

can we get tickets?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, but only the cheap tickets.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.27, compound: 0.2144, 
how much are they?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re only $5 each.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good price.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
yes, it&#39;s cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.278, compound: 0.4019, 
where are the seats?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re behind the outfield.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
golf is so hard.
neg: 0.384, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2183, 
what&#39;s so hard about hitting a little white ball?
neg: 0.195, neu: 0.805, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1761, 
it&#39;s hard if you want to do it right.
neg: 0.144, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.134, compound: -0.0258, 
you mean like tiger?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.545, pos: 0.455, compound: 0.3612, 
no, like a good amateur golfer.
neg: 0.229, neu: 0.208, pos: 0.562, compound: 0.4939, 
what&#39;s so hard about golf?
neg: 0.297, neu: 0.703, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1761, 
there are so many things you have to do right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.286, compound: 0.5267, 
yikes! who can remember all that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you need to get a lot of lessons when you&#39;re really young.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you hear about the ball player?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the home run hitter on drugs?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
neg: 0.278, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4019, 
he said he wasn&#39;t using drugs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he apologized to the fans.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.635, pos: 0.365, compound: 0.3182, 
the league suspended him for 50 games.
neg: 0.341, neu: 0.659, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
that will cost him some money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, about $7 million.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
that will teach him a good lesson.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.633, pos: 0.367, compound: 0.4404, 
he probably won&#39;t use drugs anymore.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but it won&#39;t stop other players from using drugs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.774, pos: 0.226, compound: 0.3252, 
why is there so much crime?
neg: 0.43, neu: 0.57, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5829, 
because parents don&#39;t teach their kids right from wrong.
neg: 0.279, neu: 0.721, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
is that it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
also, there aren&#39;t enough police.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but there are a lot of police.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
there&#39;s only one police officer per 100 criminals.
neg: 0.346, neu: 0.654, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
can&#39;t we hire more police?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no. it costs too much money.
neg: 0.306, neu: 0.694, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
doesn&#39;t crime cost more than police?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.637, pos: 0.363, compound: 0.431, 
yes, it does.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.426, pos: 0.574, compound: 0.4019, 
so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
this is a great neighborhood.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.423, pos: 0.577, compound: 0.6249, 
yes, it is.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.426, pos: 0.574, compound: 0.4019,

neg: 0.0, neu: 0.426, pos: 0.574, compound: 0.4019, 
there&#39;s a real nice park nearby.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.4215, 
yes, there is.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.426, pos: 0.574, compound: 0.4019, 
i feel safe here.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
there is no crime here.
neg: 0.655, neu: 0.345, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6908, 
i wish i could move here.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
the house burned down.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what happened?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the man fell asleep.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
was he smoking?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, he was smoking a cigarette.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.597, pos: 0.403, compound: 0.4019, 
did he die?
neg: 0.661, neu: 0.339, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5994, 
yes, he did. his cat died, too.
neg: 0.319, neu: 0.442, pos: 0.239, compound: -0.2263, 
that&#39;s too bad. what about his smoke alarm?
neg: 0.496, neu: 0.504, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.7096, 
the battery was dead.
neg: 0.589, neu: 0.411, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6486, 
a good battery would have saved his life.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.467, pos: 0.533, compound: 0.6908, 
he had cigarettes, but no battery.
neg: 0.359, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
they say he has started fifteen big fires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s been in jail three times already.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why did they ever let him out?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s the law. they can&#39;t keep him in jail forever.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why not? everyone knows he&#39;s a firebug. he loves to start fires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.27, compound: 0.5719, 
i don&#39;t know. sometimes the law doesn&#39;t make sense.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but his latest fire killed someone.
neg: 0.7, neu: 0.3, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.8847, 
this time they have charged him with murder.
neg: 0.52, neu: 0.48, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.7579, 
so maybe he&#39;ll go to jail forever?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i sure hope so.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.161, pos: 0.839, compound: 0.6369, 
someone should set him on fire.
neg: 0.324, neu: 0.676, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
put your seatbelt on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because it will protect you in case of an accident.
neg: 0.226, neu: 0.584, pos: 0.19, compound: -0.128, 
but it&#39;s uncomfortable.
neg: 0.63, neu: 0.37, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
it&#39;s the law.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s so much trouble.
neg: 0.498, neu: 0.502, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4549, 
it&#39;s common sense.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s so tight that it&#39;s hard for me to breathe.
neg: 0.135, neu: 0.865, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1027, 
hold your breath till we get there.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
okay, my seatbelt is on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.678, pos: 0.322, compound: 0.2263,

neg: 0.0, neu: 0.495, pos: 0.505, compound: 0.6261, 
what are you doing?

i&#39;m going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.

what are you standing on?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
are you crazy?
neg: 0.545, neu: 0.455, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
those books will slip and you&#39;ll fall.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s only a couple of feet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what if you fall while you&#39;re holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i never thought about that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you&#39;d be blind for the rest of your life!
neg: 0.272, neu: 0.728, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4574, 
did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. i called for a clean-up.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
a puddle of water is very dangerous.
neg: 0.404, neu: 0.596, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5256, 
it isn&#39;t easy to see.
neg: 0.376, neu: 0.624, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3412, 
but it&#39;s real easy to slip on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.609, pos: 0.391, compound: 0.5927, 
especially on these slick floors.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
someone who slips could hurt their back.
neg: 0.362, neu: 0.638, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
they could even crack their head open.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we can leave if we put an orange cone here.
neg: 0.118, neu: 0.882, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
yes, but i don&#39;t know where the orange cones are.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.812, pos: 0.188, compound: 0.2144, 
what happens when the fire alarm rings?
neg: 0.49, neu: 0.51, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5859, 
we tell our students to leave the classroom.
neg: 0.146, neu: 0.854, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
can they take their belongings?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, if they do it quickly.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.649, pos: 0.351, compound: 0.4019, 
where do the students go?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they go out to the north parking lot.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do the teachers do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why do you do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.753, pos: 0.247, compound: 0.3818, 
if they are all outside, then what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i have to go back upstairs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why? we&#39;re already late.

i have to check the stove.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
maybe i left the burner on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, you didn&#39;t. i checked the stove before we left.
neg: 0.216, neu: 0.784, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
are you sure?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.465, pos: 0.535, compound: 0.3182, 
of course i&#39;m sure.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.566, pos: 0.434, compound: 0.3182, 
well, i have to go back upstairs anyway.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.741, pos: 0.259, compound: 0.2732, 
it&#39;s getting later every minute.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i think i left the water running.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the city is buying guns.

what are they paying?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.
neg: 0.397, neu: 0.603, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5574, 
why are they doing this?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they want to get guns off the street.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.843, pos: 0.157, compound: 0.0772, 
who would turn in a gun for $200?

natural food has more vitamins.

how do you prepare the potatoes?

why not?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he made promises that he didn&#39;t keep.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.698, pos: 0.302, compound: 0.3818, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.737, pos: 0.263, compound: 0.3612, 
how many did he hire?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
one hundred!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe he had a good reason.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
maybe he&#39;s just a liar.
neg: 0.524, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5106, 
i can&#39;t believe he won the election.
neg: 0.375, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4585, 
only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that is a joke.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.524, compound: 0.296, 
voting is so important, but people don&#39;t bother.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.586, pos: 0.414, compound: 0.5002, 
many people think their vote doesn&#39;t matter.
neg: 0.152, neu: 0.848, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0191, 
the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.619, pos: 0.381, compound: 0.5719, 
we&#39;re stuck with him for four more years.
neg: 0.222, neu: 0.778, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.25, 
voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.728, pos: 0.272, compound: 0.5777, 
all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
how easy is that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.508, pos: 0.492, compound: 0.4404, 
i guess people just don&#39;t care.
neg: 0.396, neu: 0.604, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3875, 
well, we have a new president.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.656, pos: 0.344, compound: 0.2732, 
but we have the same old problems.
neg: 0.372, neu: 0.628, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5499, 
well, he&#39;s made a few changes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.656, pos: 0.344, compound: 0.2732, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh, yeah. he&#39;s changing it to a basketball court.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.239, compound: 0.296, 
who&#39;s paying for that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i think we are!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, that&#39;s okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.419, pos: 0.581, compound: 0.8883, 
yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.368, pos: 0.632, compound: 0.8225, 
do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
people say that everybody loves obama.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.575, pos: 0.425, compound: 0.5719, 
well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.208, compound: 0.2732, 
that&#39;s 50 million people who don&#39;t love obama.
neg: 0.325, neu: 0.675, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5216, 
obama&#39;s got four years to make everyone happy.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.654, pos: 0.346, compound: 0.5719, 
he&#39;s never going to make everyone happy.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.619, pos: 0.381, compound: 0.5719, 
can you imagine being president?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
everyone wants you to solve their problems.
neg: 0.284, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.189, compound: -0.2263, 
i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
neg: 0.385, neu: 0.49, pos: 0.126, compound: -0.5719, 
you and everybody else.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i would never want to be president.
neg: 0.196, neu: 0.804, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0572, 
but think about all the power you&#39;d have.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you read this article?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what article?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
only 11 percent?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
about 50 percent of the time he&#39;s traveling.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
where does he travel to?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh, all over the world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but he&#39;s supposed to be making our city a better place.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.7, pos: 0.3, compound: 0.5927, 
he&#39;s visiting other cities to get ideas.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
can&#39;t he just go online?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the rest of the time he&#39;s raising money for his reelection.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who did you vote for for president?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i voted for ralph nader.

who in the world is ralph nader?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s the best man for president.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.543, pos: 0.457, compound: 0.6369, 
why&#39;s that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he hates corporations.
neg: 0.592, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
well, most corporations do think only about money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.769, pos: 0.231, compound: 0.2732, 
he hates democrats and republicans.
neg: 0.42, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
well, they do put their party before their country.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.593, pos: 0.407, compound: 0.5859, 
he&#39;s the only candidate that i trust.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.602, pos: 0.398, compound: 0.5106, 
but he didn&#39;t have a chance. nobody voted for him!
neg: 0.231, neu: 0.769, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3404, 
i don&#39;t know why i bother to vote.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.711, pos: 0.289, compound: 0.2584, 
why&#39;s that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what good does it do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
you get to put someone in power that you like.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.783, pos: 0.217, compound: 0.3612, 
only if my candidate wins.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.481, compound: 0.5719, 
well, he can&#39;t win unless you and others vote for him.
neg: 0.217, neu: 0.635, pos: 0.148, compound: -0.2434, 
but even if my candidate wins, he&#39;ll break his promises.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.486, pos: 0.514, compound: 0.8573, 
that&#39;s true. they promise anything just so they get elected.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.611, pos: 0.389, compound: 0.6249, 
and when elected, they go their own way.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they forget who put them in power.
neg: 0.241, neu: 0.759, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2263, 
they forget where they came from.
neg: 0.275, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2263, 
that election for u.s. senator stunk.
neg: 0.342, neu: 0.658, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3818, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
there were more votes than voters!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but that&#39;s impossible.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
officials said that it&#39;s possible.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did they explain how it&#39;s possible?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no. they said there are some things you can&#39;t explain.
neg: 0.196, neu: 0.804, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
so are they going to hold another election?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no. that will cost too much money.
neg: 0.268, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
so it&#39;s better to save money than to have an honest election?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.482, pos: 0.518, compound: 0.8651, 
well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.464, pos: 0.536, compound: 0.7964, 
i see that former president bush is at a conference.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. he&#39;s telling jokes about his eight years as president.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.63, pos: 0.37, compound: 0.5719, 
yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.571, pos: 0.429, compound: 0.7184, 
only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.
neg: 0.429, neu: 0.571, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6705, 
not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s nice that he found the time to make a visit.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.763, pos: 0.237, compound: 0.4215, 
he spoke to them and made them feel better.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.734, pos: 0.266, compound: 0.4404, 
did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
neg: 0.223, neu: 0.777, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3182, 
no, he didn&#39;t have time to do that.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
well, he&#39;s got plenty of time now!
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.715, pos: 0.285, compound: 0.3382, 
did you get your official sample ballot?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, with the voter instructions.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.597, pos: 0.403, compound: 0.4019, 
how are you going to vote?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
against all of them, of course.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
neg: 0.127, neu: 0.873, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1531, 
we&#39;ve already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
neg: 0.133, neu: 0.867, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1759, 
that&#39;s true. where did that money go?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.682, pos: 0.318, compound: 0.4215, 
our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they are having a good time with our money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.293, compound: 0.4404, 
have you decided how you are going to vote?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.384, compound: 0.6808, 
you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
neg: 0.196, neu: 0.804, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3491, 
do you believe the tv ads?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.679, pos: 0.321, compound: 0.6369, 
don&#39;t believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.795, pos: 0.205, compound: 0.4753, 
but the title of measure 1 is &#34;better schools at no cost.&#34;
neg: 0.179, neu: 0.575, pos: 0.246, compound: 0.2617, 
the title should be &#34;better schools at huge cost.&#34;
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.574, pos: 0.426, compound: 0.6369, 
i can&#39;t believe that they would lie to us.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i have a stomachache.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
is it something you ate?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe. i&#39;m not sure.
neg: 0.395, neu: 0.605, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2411, 
what did you have for breakfast?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe the milk was bad.
neg: 0.467, neu: 0.533, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5423, 
it didn&#39;t smell bad.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.513, pos: 0.487, compound: 0.431, 
maybe the banana was bad.
neg: 0.467, neu: 0.533, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5423, 
no, the banana was delicious.
neg: 0.247, neu: 0.337, pos: 0.416, compound: 0.3612, 
maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, that&#39;s not the problem.
neg: 0.295, neu: 0.402, pos: 0.303, compound: 0.015, 
what&#39;s this stain?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t know.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it looks like blood.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.545, pos: 0.455, compound: 0.3612, 
i think my nose was bleeding.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you should wet your shirt immediately.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s a little blood?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
your white shirt is ruined.
neg: 0.437, neu: 0.563, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
so, i&#39;ll just buy another one.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you can wear this one around the house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
my fingers hurt.
neg: 0.63, neu: 0.37, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
why do they hurt?
neg: 0.531, neu: 0.469, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
i type too much.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you should take a break.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i need to type to make money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but typing is causing you pain.
neg: 0.471, neu: 0.529, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6652, 
maybe i should see a doctor.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
doctors are too expensive.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he might tell me to rest for a while.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he might want to cut you open.
neg: 0.25, neu: 0.595, pos: 0.155, compound: -0.2023, 
he might say i&#39;m okay.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.678, pos: 0.322, compound: 0.2263, 
what did the doctor say?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he thinks i have too much stress.
neg: 0.359, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
stress causes your stomachaches?
neg: 0.483, neu: 0.517, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
stress causes different problems with different people.
neg: 0.524, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6705, 
so what did he tell you to do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he said i need to think positive.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.581, pos: 0.419, compound: 0.5574, 
he didn&#39;t give you any medication?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i hate medication. it makes me feel different.
neg: 0.381, neu: 0.619, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
so how do you think positive?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.581, pos: 0.419, compound: 0.5574, 
i think about nice things.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.517, pos: 0.483, compound: 0.4215, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
i cut my finger.
neg: 0.512, neu: 0.488, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
how did you do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s a paper cut.
neg: 0.512, neu: 0.488, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
paper can be dangerous.
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
it hurts, too.
neg: 0.608, neu: 0.392, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
paper cuts can hurt a lot.
neg: 0.651, neu: 0.349, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6808, 
where are the band-aids?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

they are so weak.
neg: 0.555, neu: 0.445, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5777, 
a little cigarette controls them.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they look so stupid taking a puff.
neg: 0.466, neu: 0.534, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.656, 
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they think it&#39;s cool.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.566, pos: 0.434, compound: 0.3182,

i want to get a tan. i don&#39;t want to look so pale.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.755, pos: 0.245, compound: 0.1531, 
what&#39;s wrong with looking pale?
neg: 0.437, neu: 0.563, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
people think you might be sick.

who thinks that?

i don&#39;t know.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s better to be pale than to have skin cancer.

i know that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

all it takes is will power, and you have it.

you should see a doctor.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
my doctor said i need surgery.

cigarettes, of course.

how can he do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s a chain smoker.

that&#39;s unbelievable. can he still breathe?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.735, pos: 0.265, compound: 0.2023, 
he can, but the people around him can&#39;t.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
how can he still be alive?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.658, pos: 0.342, compound: 0.3818, 
his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.6, pos: 0.4, compound: 0.7184, 
i hate brushing my teeth.

what did they do in the old days?

they brushed with their fingers.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they also ate with their fingers!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why do they call it the good old days?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.734, pos: 0.266, compound: 0.4404, 
maybe because they didn&#39;t have to brush and floss.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who invented flossing?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a dentist, i&#39;m sure.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.465, pos: 0.535, compound: 0.3182, 
i hate flossing more than brushing!
neg: 0.499, neu: 0.501, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6114, 
let&#39;s stop for a while. i need a break and some water.
neg: 0.216, neu: 0.784, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
this trail is hard to climb.

especially on a hot day like this.

thank goodness! i don&#39;t want to see any wild animals.

all we&#39;ve seen so far is a couple of lizards.

we&#39;re hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.

i bet i&#39;ve lost a couple of pounds already.
neg: 0.277, neu: 0.723, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3182, 
all you&#39;ve lost is some sweat.
neg: 0.315, neu: 0.685, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3182, 
i haven&#39;t even lost one pound of fat?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.754, pos: 0.246, compound: 0.2411, 
if you want to lose fat, you&#39;ve got to do this hike every day.
neg: 0.169, neu: 0.75, pos: 0.081, compound: -0.34, 
oh no, another pimple on my face.

pimples suck.
neg: 0.744, neu: 0.256, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.762, pos: 0.238, compound: 0.3612, 
maybe it&#39;s something in your diet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, i eat the same things day after day.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
then maybe it&#39;s in your genes.

you might be right.

do pimples run in your family?

not that i&#39;ve noticed.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, maybe it&#39;s from the pollution in the air.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.208, compound: 0.2732, 
whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.
neg: 0.316, neu: 0.684, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
do you believe everything you hear?

i don&#39;t believe anything i don&#39;t see with my own eyes.

you can&#39;t believe what you hear on tv or radio.

you can&#39;t believe what you read in the newspapers.

everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
three different people will give you three different stories.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and the government will give you a fourth story.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
neg: 0.143, neu: 0.439, pos: 0.418, compound: 0.6131, 
but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico.
neg: 0.547, neu: 0.453, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.8922, 
the government says we have nothing to worry about.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.769, pos: 0.231, compound: 0.3412, 
then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?

then wait till you find a tissue.

i couldn&#39;t wait. it was an emergency.
neg: 0.342, neu: 0.658, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3818, 
oh, really? maybe you should have called 911.

don&#39;t rub the numbers off the remote.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

i was on a plane.

so?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
neg: 0.236, neu: 0.764, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
that&#39;s no good.
neg: 0.361, neu: 0.164, pos: 0.475, compound: 0.1779, 
sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.
neg: 0.292, neu: 0.708, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5106, 
have you seen a doctor?

what do you mean?

a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.

why did they do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a mad dog bit most of her face off.
neg: 0.314, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4939, 
oh, that&#39;s terrible. what does she look like now?
neg: 0.246, neu: 0.556, pos: 0.198, compound: -0.1531, 
her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

what do you think it is?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t know. i think it&#39;s old age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
if it&#39;s old age, why don&#39;t both of your hands hurt?
neg: 0.254, neu: 0.746, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
that&#39;s a good question. maybe it&#39;s not old age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.293, compound: 0.4404, 
are you right-handed?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. all my life.
